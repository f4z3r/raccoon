# raccoon [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jakobbeckmann/raccoon.svg?token=6RwG9cGf5RW9JwThwdpc&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jakobbeckmann/raccoon)
A library providing similar capabilities to `pandas`'s `DataFrame` in python. The intent of this library is to facilitate the handling of large amounts of data.

## Documentation
In time, I will link the documentation provided by `rustdoc` here.

## Roadmap
I wish to implement the following features:

- [ ] a cell-like entry that is data independent.
- [ ] a `Series` object that contains a list of cells of the same type.
- [ ] a `DataFrame` object containing a list of `Series`.
- [ ] `DataFrame` loading from csv and excel files.
- [ ] operations on `DataFrame`s similar to the supported operations in `pandas`.
- [ ] full and clear documentation of the entire crate.
- [ ] push the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
